> A free Python-based software application (GPL) for image processing and classification of high-resolution satellite imagery. The **Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Scientific Computing** libraries are based on *scipy, numpy, OpenCV, scikit-learn* **GUI** is based in *Tkinter*.

## Features:

> Import functionality for Multi-Format Satellite data (TIFF - Tagged Image File Format, PNG, JPG)

> Splitting image into component bands

> Merging bands through different colors, to make visible subtle contrasting features.

> Creation of user-defined False Color Composite (FCC) images.

> Preprocessing

> Display/ Enhancement

> Spatial Enhancement - Bands are passed through high pass and low pass filters - Mean filters, 

> Median Filters, Sobel, Kisrch, Gaussian and Fourier Transfom filters.

> Spectral Enhancement – NDVI, RVI, TVI. Principal Component Analysis and Fourier 
transform.

> Contrast Enhancement-linear, logarithmic, exponential and piecewise linear 

> Point Operations, Histogram Equalization

> Calculation of important indices 

> Image Reduction, Magnification, Local Operations

> Feature Classification – using Machine Learning algorithms

> Personalized results – region selection

> Conclusions about resulted Images


##Libraries Used

1. **GDAL** – Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ( a C++ library wrapped for Python support )

GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under 

anX/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents 

a single raster abstract data model and vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported 

formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing.

2. **OpenCV** – standard Image processing library

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning 

software library. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify 

the code. The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both 

classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used 

to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, 

track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch 

images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image 

database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and 

establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc.

3. **Python Imaging Library** – Basic raster image support

The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. This 

library supports many file formats, and provides powerful image processing and graphics capabilities.

4. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

###  a powerful N-dimensional array object

###  sophisticated (broadcasting) functions

###  tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code

###  useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

4. Matplotlib – For Data analysis, visualization, etc

5. Python standard library

6. Tkinter library – for GUI frontend programming. Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.
